    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this ipython notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 25% of mark for class\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Overview</b>: For this project, you'll be building a 3-way polarity classification system for tweets, using a logistic regression classifier, BOW features, as well as polarity lexicons built from external sources. A key focus of this project is critical analysis and experimental evaluation, for which you will need to report on the relative merits of various options. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Sci-kit Learn, and Gemsim. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python build-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. You are encouraged to use the iPython notebooks released for this class as well as other online documentation to guide your responses, but you should not copy directly from any source. The only other data you will need is three sets of tagged tweets, the first two of which (training and dev) were released at the same time as this notebook, and a third set (test) which will be made available about a week before the assignment is due, see Final Testing below. This data comes from the recent SemEval 2016 shared task. Do not distribute this data indiscriminately (i.e. put it on a public website), you should use it only for this assignment, and delete it afterwards. The corpus is comprised of unfiltered text from the web, and may include offensive or objectionable material. This reflects the general composition of the web and the general challenges present in web based text analysis. The University of Melbourne takes no responsibility for opinions expressed in the corpus, nor takes any responsibility for offence caused by these documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time (less than 10 minutes on a lab desktop), and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements. You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also on your explanation and analysis. Please do not change any of instruction text in the notebook. Where applicable, leave the output cells in the code, particularly when you are commenting on that output. You should add your answers and code by inserting a markdown cell between every major function or other block of code explaining its purpose or anywhere a result needs to be discussed (see the class notebooks for examples). Note that even if you do something wrong, you might get partial credit if you explain it enough that we can follow your reasoning, whereas a fully correct assignment with no text commentary will not receive a passing score. You will not be marked directly on the performance of your final classifier, but each of the steps you take to build it should be reasonable and well-defended.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this project, and we encourage you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, it is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "<b>Instructions</b>: Your first task is to carry out preprocessing on the tweets. Use the code below as a starter. Each line of the input files is a json including the tweet and the label (and the tweet id), this code just loads them into a list without any preprocessing. Note that for the labels, 1 = positive, 0 = neutral, -1 = negative. Here is a list of things your preprocessing code must do:\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Segment into sentences: Use NLTK punkt sentence segmenter</li>\n",
    "<li>Tokenize sentences: Use the NLTK regex WordPunct tokenizer</li>\n",
    "<li>Lowercase all words</li>\n",
    "<li>Remove Twitter usernames: Usernames on twitter begin with @</li>\n",
    "<li>Remove URLs: URLs start with http</li> \n",
    "<li>Remove any hashtags from their original location in the tweet, tokenize them, and add them as a separate sentences with the hash tag removed: for tokenization, use capitalized letters when they occur (e.g. #RefugeesWelcome -> Refugees Welcome), or when there is no capitalization (#refugeeswelcome -> refugees welcome) use the MaxMatch algorithm and the list of English words included in NLTK (nltk.corpus.words.words()). Two notes about the English word list: 1. you should convert it to a python set before you use it (sets are hashed, so you get much quicker lookup) 2. It contains only base forms, so you will need to lemmatize words before you look them up.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do these in almost any order you like, but it may be useful to do the main segmentation/tokenization last (or almost last), since for the other tasks it is easier to deal with the raw string rather than a list of tokens. The use of regular expressions is recommended, but not required.\n",

    "**Explanations**: \n",
    "\n",
    "It is easier to do case transformation, username and URL removal than sentence segmentation and tokenization. But the case transformation has to be set after hashtag removal, because when removing hashtags, it needs the feature of capitalized letter to tokenize sentence. So I set username and URL removal firstly, then hashtag removal and case transformation, finally do the segmentation and tokenization by using nltk. The order of preprocessing tasks is as the following list starts with **bullet point**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove Twitter usernames\n",
    "* Remove URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "The instruction requires to remove URLs start with **http**, we thought the aim is to remove non-readable text. So we consider it to be reasonable to remove **https** as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to hashtags removal, it is not only character removal (#), but also tokenization and lemmatization need to be taken into account. However, tokenization here is different from tokenizing sentences by using nltk, we need to apply max match algorithm, so we operate hashtags' removal ahead of general sentence tokenization. There are two advantages, one is that we do not need to iterates all tokens inside a sentence to find hashtags, which means we reduce the number of iteration; the second is that after nltk regex tokenization, hashtag will be seperated with tagged sentences, which makes the sentence hard to find and tokenize. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove and tokenize hashtags.\n",
    "* Lowercase all words\n",
    "* Segment into sentences\n",
    "* Tokenize sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "We pre-compile the regex pattern to speed up the process. This is because we avoid compiling pattern inside the iteration, which is time-consuming. \n",

    "<b>Instructions</b>: Now, tune a decision tree classifier using accuracy in the development set as the evaluation metric. For this, you need to consider at least 2 parameters of the model likely to influence performance and which make sense in this context; you should read the documentation for the classifier on sci-kit learn website to learn what these parameters are. For any binary or categorical parameters, you should just consider all options. For numerical values, you should start by keep other settings on default and just randomly try a wide range, looking for values above which there is a steep drop-off in performance, or, alternatively, no effect on performance at all (you don't need to show this process in the notebook).  Remember that some parameters should be tested on a logarithmic scale. Once you're fairly confident of a good range for the parameter, divide it up into at least 5 steps (but no more than 10), and carry out a grid search, which is to say an exhaustive exploration of all parameter options within the limits you've set (this should be included in the notebook). Identify the best parameter values, and discuss the influence of the parameters on performance in the development set. Do you think some values of the parameters are resulting in overfitting?  "

The more features are used for spliting a node, the more the tree tend to overfit, but too small of that value  underfit the groud truth on the contrary. So I choose '0.9', most of features for each node spliting, and '0.99', almost all of features to check whether it overfits. The result report above gives the positive answer, every example that max_features=0.99 has lower accuracy than the corresponding example ( example holding max_leaf_nodes static).\n",

    "The value of ***max_leaf_nodes*** defines the stop criteria of the growth of tree. The deeper the tree grows, the smaller the node that leaf contain, which means the more granular the model fit the observations. This is bad, the structure risk rises. As we can see from the result on development set, the smaller the value, the lower of the accuracy. I still do not have a clue about which is better, 10 or 50, and the grid search result gives me the answer: 50. However, this is not the larger the better. It underfits if the value is too small, because the tree depth will be very short."

SentiWordNet has precalculated scores for positive, negative, and neutral sentiment for some of the words in WordNet, but, like WordNet, it is arranged in synsets; building a WSD system to handle this is beyond the scope of this assignment, instead you should take the most common polarity across its senses (neutral if there is a tie). Do this by iterating through all the synsets in WordNet (which may take a little while, the code snippet below has a counter to show your progress), and then create two lists, one of positive words, one of negative words. Show 5 examples of each of the positive and negative words, and comment on their quality."

    "<b>Instructions</b>: When the final test set has been released, you should start with your best classifier from your work up to this point, and do a final test of all major options, including at least one from each of the first four sections of the assignment (that is, at least one preprocessing option, at least one tuning parameter/classifier type, at least one lexicon, and your improvement), in this new dataset. You don't need to explore every possible combination (in fact, you shouldn't), but you should make a convincing case that you have probably found the best combination given the possibilities you have implemented. It's okay if you find discrepancies between the best classifier on the test set and development set, just be sure to mention them. In a final discussion (which should be at least 500 words), you should include at least one bar graph of accuracy across various options, and at least one table which reports precision, recall, and F-score for each label as well as the macroaveraged F-score (all figures and tables should be generated inline by your code, using matplotlib). Please conclude your discussion by discussing what you have learned, and mentioning any other ideas for improving performance of this system that you may have.\n",
